# The Gender Disparity in Programming Languages on Stack Overflow

In this project, we will investigate the gender disparities in programming languages and developer roles. We will focus our analysis on a dataset of users from the website Stack Overflow.

If you want to get this running on your own computer, you can download the data from the [Stack Overflow Insights website](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey). The data should be put in a folder called "data".
